Sodor Train Schedule

My assignment for practicing Firebase and moment.js. The app allows you to add a new train line, thematic or not, and see when that train will next arrive. 

Insturctions:

    1) Fill out the form, adding in the name, destination, when it first departs from the station, and how often that train will leave.

    2) Hit the submit button and watch it form a new line!


Behind the scenes:

    This page utilizes two features, the table and the form. The script takes the inputs in the form and stores then into variables to be stored in and retrieved from the Firebase server. Minute.js takes the starting time and frequency and calculates when the next train will come and how much longer until the next train arrives.
